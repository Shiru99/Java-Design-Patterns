# Java Design Patterns

## Java Design Patterns: Creational

### [Singleton](#singleton)

1. Only one instance of the class is created.
2. Guarantee control of a resource.
3. Lazily loaded.
4. Examples: Runtime, Logger, Spring Bean 


### [Builder](#builder)

1. Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the two can vary independently.
2. Examples: StringBuilder


### [Prototype](#prototype)

1. Create a new object by copying the original object using the clone methods.


### [Factory Method](#factory-method)

1. Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
2. Examples: Calender


### [Abstract Factory](#abstract-factory)

1. Provide an interface for creating a family of products, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
2. Examples: JDBC Connection
